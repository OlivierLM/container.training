# Exposing containers

- `kubectl expose` creates a *service* for existing pods

- A *service* is a stable address for a pod (or a bunch of pods)

- If we want to connect to our pod(s), we need to create a *service*

- Once a service is created, CoreDNS will allow us to resolve it by name

  (i.e. after creating service `hello`, the name `hello` will resolve to something)

- There are different types of services, detailed on the following slides:

  `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`, `ExternalName`

- HTTP services can also use `Ingress` resources (more on that later)

---

## `ClusterIP`

- It's the default service type

- A virtual IP address is allocated for the service

  (in an internal, private range; e.g. 10.96.0.0/12)

- This IP address is reachable only from within the cluster (nodes and pods)

- Our code can connect to the service using the original port number

- Perfect for internal communication, within the cluster

---

## `LoadBalancer`

- An external load balancer is allocated for the service

  (typically a cloud load balancer, e.g. ELB on AWS, GLB on GCE ...)

- This is available only when the underlying infrastructure provides some kind of
  "load balancer as a service"

- Each service of that type will typically cost a little bit of money

  (e.g. a few cents per hour on AWS or GCE)

- Ideally, traffic would flow directly from the load balancer to the pods

- In practice, it will often flow through a `NodePort` first

---

## `NodePort`

- A port number is allocated for the service

  (by default, in the 30000-32767 range)

- That port is made available *on all our nodes* and anybody can connect to it

  (we can connect to any node on that port to reach the service)

- Our code needs to be changed to connect to that new port number

- Under the hood: `kube-proxy` sets up a bunch of `iptables` rules on our nodes

- Sometimes, it's the only available option for external traffic

  (e.g. most clusters deployed with kubeadm or on-premises)

---

class: extra-details

## `ExternalName`

- No load balancer (internal or external) is created

- Only a DNS entry gets added to the DNS managed by Kubernetes

- That DNS entry will just be a `CNAME` to a provided record

Example:
```bash
kubectl create service externalname k8s --external-name kubernetes.io
```
*Creates a CNAME `k8s` pointing to `kubernetes.io`*

---

## Running containers with open ports

- Since `ping` doesn't have anything to connect to, we'll have to run something else

- We could use the `nginx` official image, but ...

  ... we wouldn't be able to tell the backends from each other!

- We are going to use `jpetazzo/httpenv`, a tiny HTTP server written in Go

- `jpetazzo/httpenv` listens on port 8888

- It serves its environment variables in JSON format

- The environment variables will include `HOSTNAME`, which will be the pod name

  (and therefore, will be different on each backend)

---

## Creating a deployment for our HTTP server

- We *could* do `kubectl run httpenv --image=jpetazzo/httpenv` ...

- But since `kubectl run` is being deprecated, let's see how to use `kubectl create` instead

.exercise[

- In another window, watch the pods (to see when they are created):
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  ```

<!-- ```keys ^C``` -->

- Create a deployment for this very lightweight HTTP server:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment httpenv --image=jpetazzo/httpenv
  ```

- Scale it to 10 replicas:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment httpenv --replicas=10
  ```

]

---

## Exposing our deployment

- We'll create a default `ClusterIP` service

.exercise[

- Expose the HTTP port of our server:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment httpenv --port 8888
  ```

- Look up which IP address was allocated:
  ```bash
  kubectl get service
  ```

]

---

## Services are layer 4 constructs

- You can assign IP addresses to services, but they are still *layer 4*

  (i.e. a service is not an IP address; it's an IP address + protocol + port)

- This is caused by the current implementation of `kube-proxy`

  (it relies on mechanisms that don't support layer 3)

- As a result: you *have to* indicate the port number for your service
    
- Running services with arbitrary port (or port ranges) requires hacks

  (e.g. host networking mode)

---

## Testing our service

- We will now send a few HTTP requests to our pods

.exercise[

- Let's obtain the IP address that was allocated for our service, *programmatically:*
  ```bash
  IP=$(kubectl get svc httpenv -o go-template --template '{{ .spec.clusterIP }}')
  ```

<!--
```hide kubectl wait deploy httpenv --for condition=available```
-->

- Send a few requests:
  ```bash
  curl http://$IP:8888/
  ```

- Too much output? Filter it with `jq`:
  ```bash
  curl -s http://$IP:8888/ | jq .HOSTNAME
  ```

]

--

Try it a few times! Our requests are load balanced across multiple pods.

## If we don't need a load balancer

- Sometimes, we want to access our scaled services directly:

  - if we want to save a tiny little bit of latency (typically less than 1ms)

  - if we need to connect over arbitrary ports (instead of a few fixed ones)

  - if we need to communicate over another protocol than UDP or TCP

  - if we want to decide how to balance the requests client-side

  - ...

- In that case, we can use a "headless service"

---

class: extra-details

## Headless services

- A headless service is obtained by setting the `clusterIP` field to `None`

  (Either with `--cluster-ip=None`, or by providing a custom YAML)

- As a result, the service doesn't have a virtual IP address

- Since there is no virtual IP address, there is no load balancer either

- CoreDNS will return the pods' IP addresses as multiple `A` records

- This gives us an easy way to discover all the replicas for a deployment

---

class: extra-details

## Services and endpoints

- A service has a number of "endpoints"

- Each endpoint is a host + port where the service is available

- The endpoints are maintained and updated automatically by Kubernetes

.exercise[

- Check the endpoints that Kubernetes has associated with our `httpenv` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe service httpenv
  ```

]

In the output, there will be a line starting with `Endpoints:`.

That line will list a bunch of addresses in `host:port` format.

---

class: extra-details

## Viewing endpoint details

- When we have many endpoints, our display commands truncate the list
  ```bash
  kubectl get endpoints
  ```

- If we want to see the full list, we can use one of the following commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe endpoints httpenv
  kubectl get endpoints httpenv -o yaml
  ```

- These commands will show us a list of IP addresses

- These IP addresses should match the addresses of the corresponding pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l app=httpenv -o wide
  ```

---

class: extra-details

## `endpoints` not `endpoint`

- `endpoints` is the only resource that cannot be singular

```bash
$ kubectl get endpoint
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "endpoint"
```

- This is because the type itself is plural (unlike every other resource)

- There is no `endpoint` object: `type Endpoints struct`

- The type doesn't represent a single endpoint, but a list of endpoints

---

class: extra-details

## `ExternalIP`

- When creating a service, we can also specify an `ExternalIP`

  (this is not a type, but an extra attribute to the service)

- It will make the service availableon this IP address

  (if the IP address belongs to a node of the cluster)

---

## `Ingress`

- Ingresses are another type (kind) of resource

- They are specifically for HTTP services

  (not TCP or UDP)

- They can also handle TLS certificates, URL rewriting ...

- They require an *Ingress Controller* to function
